## 🔍 About SafeTrust

**SafeTrust** is a Web3-powered platform that brings security and transparency to rental transactions. By using blockchain, SafeTrust protects both the renter and asset owner, making rental agreements seamless and trustworthy.

### 🔒 How It Works

1. **Secure Deposits**: For example, when renting a house, a deposit is securely held in a smart contract, ensuring protection for both parties.
2. **Transaction Safety**: If conditions are met (no damage, no breach of terms), the renter’s deposit is returned after transparent validation through SafeTrust.
3. **Dispute Resolution**: Automated and transparent dispute handling ensures fair outcomes based on predefined terms agreed by both parties.

### 🌟 Why SafeTrust?

- **🔐 Security**: Blockchain ensures funds are secure and tamper-proof.
- **🌈 Transparency**: Every transaction is visible on the blockchain, ensuring a fair process.
- **🌍 Decentralized Trust**: No need for intermediaries – enjoy a decentralized experience!
